# PACMAN in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS
This is another Tutorial Walkthorugh Repo. I create these repos (starting with twr-*) when I follow along with a tutorial.

This repo is for the follow along of Ania Kub√≥w's [Build PACMAN in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS - Walkthrough!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeUGlSl2i4Q)

You can [play this PAC-MAN clone hosted on GitHub.io](https://rgroves.github.io/twr-pac-man-in-pure-js/)

The original-tutorial-code branch is what I ended up with at the end of the tutorial, which should roughly match Ania's repo which you can find via the link in the YouTube video's description.

The other branches I will be adding will be little tweaks/improvements to the tutorial code.
