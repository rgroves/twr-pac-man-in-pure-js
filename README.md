# PACMAN in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS

This is another Tutorial Walkthorugh Repo. I create these repos (starting with twr-*) when I follow along with a tutorial.

This repo is for the follow along of Ania Kub√≥w's [Build PACMAN in vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS - Walkthrough!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeUGlSl2i4Q)

You can [play my version of this PAC-MAN clone hosted on GitHub.io](https://rgroves.github.io/twr-pac-man-in-pure-js/)

The [original-tutorial-code branch](https://github.com/rgroves/twr-pac-man-in-pure-js/tree/original-tutorial-code) is what I ended up with at the end of the tutorial, which should roughly match Ania's repo which you can find via the link in the YouTube video's description.

The other branches I will be adding will be little tweaks/improvements to the tutorial code. I will merge those into the master branch as I complete each improvement/addition so that the live hosted version linked above will have those included.

I'm keeping a list of notes for additions here: [NOTES.md](NOTES.md)
