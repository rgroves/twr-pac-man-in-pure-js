Here's a list of the tweaks/additions I can think about making to this project:

- [x] Update usage of KeyboardEvent.keyCode to use KeyboardEvent.code instead.
  - References:
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/keyCode
    - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/code
- [x] Simplify PAC-MAN movement logic
- [ ] Give ghosts a +1 to INT (increase their smarts just a bit for now)
  - Make ghosts just a little bit smarter (for now):
  - [x] Give ghosts a way to know if they are still in the lair
  - [ ] Give ghosts a way to know that they should move out of the lair when in it
  - [ ] Once a ghost is out of the lair it should not move back into it on it's own (only respawn gets it back in)
  - [x] Eliminate standing around: narrow a ghost's move options to only those cells that are valid open spaces
- [x] Fix ghost eats PAC-MAN game over condition
  - Currently only when PAC-MAN moves into a ghost does the game end.
- [ ] Keep PAC-MAN moving like the joystick version
- [x] Give the ghosts more of a ghost look
- [ ] Remove hardcoded indices for warp areas
- [ ] Give ghosts eyes that look in the direction it is heading
- [ ] Need to fix PAC-MAN walking into a scared ghost allows pass-through; does not trigger score & respawn of ghost.
- [x] Give the board more atmosphere.
